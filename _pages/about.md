# Under Construction (but not for long!)

Hey there! I'm an AI researcher/engineer who's passionate about all things AI, machine learning, and computer science. I'm always on the lookout for the latest and greatest in the field, and I love sharing what I learn with others.


This blog is my way of doing just that. I'll be posting about everything from cutting-edge research to practical tips and tricks for coding up your own AI projects. I'll also be sharing some of my own projects and experiments, so you can see what I'm up to behind the scenes.


In the meantime, here's food for thought:



Shannon once said:
> "Information is the resolution of uncertainty"

Short, sweet, and it makes you think, right? Kinda like solving a puzzle, but the puzzle is... everything.

Sutton threw this one out there:
> "General methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin"

Basically, "work smarter, not harder" - but with more compute. It's the secret sauce behind a lot of AI breakthroughs.

Karpathy saw the future (or maybe caused it?):
> "Software 2.0 will become increasingly prevalent in any domain where repeated evaluation is possible and cheap..."

He's talking about AI taking over coding jobs. Gulp. But hey, it's all about efficiency, right?

And Stroustrup, keeping it real:
> "Cut until there is nothing left to cut and all there is left is principled and fundamental"

Words to live by, especially when your code starts looking like spaghetti.

These nuggets of wisdom keep me going when I'm drowning in data or debugging for the umpteenth time. Hope they give you a little boost, too!
